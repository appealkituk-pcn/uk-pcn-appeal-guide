  <h1>Private Parking Charge Appeal Examples</h1>

  <h2>Example 1: No keeper liability</h2>
  <p>The operator failed to comply with the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, meaning the registered keeper was not liable.</p>

  <h2>Example 2: Unclear signage</h2>
  <p>Signs were not visible on entry, making the parking terms unenforceable.</p>

  <h2>Example 3: Incorrect vehicle data</h2>
  <p>The notice contained errors in vehicle registration details.</p>
